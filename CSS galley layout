CSS is used to set the dimensions and background color for each

element. The dimensions of the images themselves are also set using CSS.
Create css image layout
A background texture is applied to the whole page by repeating an image with the texture behind the element. A repeating background image is sometimes referred to as wallpaper. The content of the page is put inside a

element . This is used to fix the width of the page to 720 pixels. Its left and right margins are set to auto to center it in the middle of the screen. The images sit inside an HTML5 element, and their captions are provided in the element.For the captions, a background image is used to the left of the text. We do not want this image to fill the background so we specify that it should not repeat. Padding is used to the left of the text so that the words do not go over the background image. Each of the elements is contained within a
, which has two purposes. Firstly, it is used to create the three-column layout by specifying a width and margins for the element and then floating it to the left. Secondly, it adds a subtle shadow underneath each image. This creates a three-dimensional appearance making it look like a piece of card. To ensure that this sits underneath the image, the backgroundposition property is used. Like for an example:
<title>Images</title> <style type="text/css"> body { color: #665544; background-color: #d4d0c6; background-image: url("images/backdrop.gif"); font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif; text-align: center;} .wrapper { width: 720px; margin: 0px auto;} .header { margin: 40px 0px 20px 0px;} .entry { width: 220px; float: left; margin: 10px; height: 198px; background-image: url("images/shadow.png"); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: bottom;} figure { display: block; width: 202px; height: 170px; background-color: #e7e3d8; padding: 9px; text-align: left;} figure img { width: 200px; height: 150px; border: 1px solid #d6d6d6;} figcaption { background-image: url("images/icon.png"); padding-left: 20px; background-repeat: no-repeat;} </style> IMAGES 424 Example IMAGES
