This passage is giving information on a piece of software that you can download and install on your computer called Text Editor, it allows you to write and build a web site,text
 editor should be one of the most important tool. A web designer uses, to build his or hers web site, because it has many great features that a web designer can choose from, like code completion, it allows you to start typing and it also displays possible suggestions and saves time by giving you chooses. Another feature of text editor is Syntax highlighting which takes the text you type and make it noticable by colorizing your statement ,and it makes it easier to see and read also helps you find erros and revise.
 The Command Line!
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
Line 1 presents us with a prompt ( user@bash ). After that we entered a command ( ls ). Typically a command is always the first thing you type. After that we have what are referred to as command line arguments ( -l /home/ryan ). Important to note, these are separated by spaces (there must be a space between the command and the first command line argument also). The first command line argument ( -l ) is also referred to as an option. Options are typically used to modify t
he behaviour of the command. Options are usually listed before other arguments and typically start with a dash ( - ).
Lines 2 - 5 are output from running the command. Most commands produce output and it will be listed straight under the issuing of the command. Other commands just perform their task and don't display any information unless there was an error.
Line 6 presents us with a prompt again. After the command has run and the terminal is ready for you to enter another command the prompt will be displayed. If no prompt is displayed then the command may still be running (you will learn later how to deal with this).
Your terminal probably won't have line numbers on it. I have just included them here to make it easier to refer to different parts of the material.
Basic Navigation!
Line 1 - We ran ls in it's most basic form. It listed the contents of our current directory.
Line 4 - We ran ls with a single command line option ( -l ) which indicates we are going to do a long listing. A long listing has the following:
First character indicates whether it is a normal file ( - ) or directory ( d )
Next 9 characters are permissions for the file or directory (we'll learn more about them in section 6).
The next field is the number of blocks (don't worry too much about this).
The next field is the owner of the file or directory (ryan in this case).
The next field is the group the file or directory belongs to (users in this case).
Following this is the file size.
Next up is the file modification time.
Finally we have the actual name of the file or directory.
Line 10 - We ran ls with a command line argument ( /etc ). When we do this it tells ls not to list our current directory but instead to list that directories contents.
Line 13 - We ran ls with both a command line option and argument. As such it did a long listing of the directory /etc.
Lines 12 and 18 just indicate that I have cut out some of the commands normal output for brevities sake. When you run the commands you will see a longer listing of files and directories.
