# Markdown
Markdown is a way to style text on the web.You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
# Examples:
-Headers:# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
  
  -Emphasis: *This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

# Lists:
  -Unordered:* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
  
  Ordered: 1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
   
  - Blockquotes
  > We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

-Inline code
  I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
