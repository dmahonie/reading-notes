Hi my name is Diane Mahonie I am from agape I am a mother of 3 children I am interested in learning how to code and set up web sites to enhance my knowledge for the technology of coding software. And to one day open my own business with the skills I learn from taking these courses over the next 6 months. Also to develop a portfolio and to enhance my career to become a software developer, and coder of my own company. To help with my financial situation, also to be a home owner.
